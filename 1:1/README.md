# 1:1
A 1:1 layout is a layout inspired by an existing keyboard layout with accommodation for all additional symbols from Custom layout.

## Blackberry Passport
A prime example of a 3 row keyboard. Needs some time to get used to, as it's an ortholinear keyboard. The shift and number row were software keys on the Blackberry, so I had to improvise and put every missing key including all existing custom layout keys as swipe keys in closest spots to them. Some keys got overcrowded like 'n', making harder to type ';'.
Quite confortable in landscape mode.
